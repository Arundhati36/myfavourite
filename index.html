     <p> My hobby is reading books. I love reading books. Reading books is a really very nice thing to do because it calms down your mind and relaxes you. It is a nice activity to do in your free time. I personally love reading books because it keeps me happy and busy. Nowadays I am really very much interested in reading books by JK Rowling. She is an amazing author. Reading books calms me and also makes me feel fresh. Some people feel that reading books is a waste of time, but I feel that if you read books, you get more creative and feel amazing. Everyone should read books and have it as a hobby. </p>
